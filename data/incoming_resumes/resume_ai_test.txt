Hi, I’m Arjun.

You can reach me anytime at arjun.mishra.work@gmail.com or on my phone.
I’ve been building software professionally for about four and a half years now,
mostly working with backend systems and data-heavy applications.

Over the last few years, I’ve spent most of my time writing Python services,
designing REST APIs, and working closely with SQL databases.
I’ve also used Django and Flask extensively, and recently started
working with FastAPI for performance-critical services.

In my previous role at a fintech startup, I was responsible for developing
transaction processing pipelines, integrating third-party APIs,
and ensuring data consistency across services.
I collaborated closely with frontend teams and product managers
to ship features on tight deadlines.

Before that, I worked as a junior developer where I got hands-on experience
with Git, Linux environments, Docker containers, and basic cloud deployments.

Academically, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science
from Visvesvaraya Technological University in 2019.

I enjoy mentoring juniors, writing clean code, and continuously improving
system reliability.
